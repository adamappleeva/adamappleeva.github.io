                <cite>According to the personality test I took, I realized that I am an ambivert who exhibits qualities of both introversion and extroversion and can flip into either depending on my emotion, context, etc. Moreover, I also enjoy practical working by touching and doing things so that I could gain experience by myself. The test also demonstrated correctly that I am a good listener and communicator. To be more specific, in the working environment, I personally often open a meeting by giving a brief pep talk, then offer other members the chance to talk about their challenges or concerns. Another thing that should be mentioned is that I easily connect to other people since I could empathize with other thoughts and emotions. As a result, this trait might be helpful to harmonize members in my team. Besides, I am an emotionally stable and conscientious person who always tries my best to finish the job. The last thing I feel reasonable in term of the test result is that I am flexible in social network and the workplace because I could adjust myself to fit the person or situation</cite>

                <h2 style= "font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color: maroon">2. My Team:</h2>
                <br><br>

                <cite>In terms of my team members, the most important trait of people who I would like to work with is conscientiousness. To be more specific, every member must have responsibility for their work. If they depend on others and are not responsible, the project will not be finished on time and the quality of the project will not be effective. Another aspect of personality that I expected my teammates must have would be diligence. Indeed, no one wants to work with the lazy and procrastinated. For instance, if we need to test the program while a lazy member could not finish his/her work as we expected, the program cannot be tested to fix it. As a result, we do not know the mistakes in our program to fix them as soon as possible. I am personally not good at writing reports. Hence, I would like to have a member who has professional writing skills in my team. Besides, I would prefer to have at least one introverted member and one extroverted member since I want my team to be balanced. To be more specific, if someone talks, the other must listen. On the one hand, if all of my teammates are introverted, then no one will talk and share their ideas with others, which leads to a lack of ideas and solutions for the team. Moreover, it would be challenging to connect the introverted people. On the other hand, if all of the members are extroverted, I supposed that everyone would be talkative and none of them would listen to other thoughts. The drawback of extroverted people is that they talk too much and do know how to listen to others. As an ambivert, I will be the person that harmonizes between introverted members and extroverted members. Furthermore, I would like to work with a person that experienced in IT before since I am a newbie and I want to learn more about IT. By working with that person, I could acknowledge better by doing and applying what he/she teaches me during working. My personality tests also showed that I am not a creative person. Therefore, I must have someone who could give interesting ideas to the team. Finally, I would like to find a detail-oriented person who could check carefully the program. Sometimes, I could not find the errors in my code since I am not careful. As a result, I need someone who can check with me and other members' works so that we could figure out the mistakes we make.</cite>

                <cite>There are 4 members in my team: Nguyen Huy Binh, Nguyen Ba Dat, Hyunwoo Choi, and I. </cite>
                <br><br>
                <h2 style = "color: darkturquoise;">☠ Nguyen Huy Binh:</h2>
                <cite>First, I want to talk about Binh who is extroverted. He has lots of experience in terms of coding and writing reports. He used to study Computer Science in the U.S like me. Hence, we have a lot of perspective in common. Besides Intro to Programming, we also join the same group in other courses. </cite>
                <br><br>
                <h2 style = "color: darkturquoise;">☠ Nguyen Ba Dat:</h2>
                <cite>The second member I want to mention is Dat who is introverted. Although it is hard to communicate with him since he rarely talks, he always comes up with interesting ideas for our projects.</cite>
                <br><br>
                <h2 style = "color: darkturquoise;">☠ Nguyen Ba Dat:</h2>
                <cite>The last one Choi is an extroverted person. He knows how to crack everyone up, how to help other members. Moreover, Choi is also a detail-oriented person, which is the member I need to check and review the progress of our project. </cite>
                <br><br>

                <cite>I am happy to work with them at RMIT. They are all great and diligent people.   </cite>
