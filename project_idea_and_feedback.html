                </div>
                <br><br>
                <cite>There are many ideas I could imagine developing in my project such as an AI app for helping the elder, a security app for smartphones so that it can lock phones if the phones are stolen, turned off and announce the location to the police, etc. However, I have to confess that my knowledge and skill in IT are not good enough to think about those aforementioned professional projects. So I decided to make a combination of location app and social app for smartphones. For the most part, the main purpose of my app is to help users check others’ locations that they add friends. Have you ever experienced that you were hanging out with your friends and lost their locations while you were traveling? Another example is that one of your friend’s smartphone was stolen and you could not contact him/her. You felt worried about that friend and do not know where he/she is. According to the Overseas Security Advisory Council, “Drive-by snatching is one of the biggest crime threats in Vietnam. Two criminals riding a motorcycle will ride up to a target; the motorcycle passenger will then snatch the victim’s camera, cell phone, or purse.” (<a style="font-size: 20px; color: green;" href="https://www.osac.gov/Content/Report/ef22f7dc-b89a-4411-b4e7-182890c1a65c" target="_blank"> www.osac.gov</a> ). As a result, my location app project is designed to solve those problems by tracking the phone’s location and reporting its location to their trusted friends’ phones. I called my app WAY, representing for “Where Are You”. Moreover, WAY also will be a social media app to connect strangers, a helpful app for travelers, companies.</cite>
                <br><br>
                <br><br>
                <cite> First, WAY will require users to provide their phone numbers to sign up for an account. Since everyone only has one phone number, using the phone number to sign up will reduce the chance to have clone accounts. After that, a code will be sent to their phone numbers and they must enter their code to WAY to verify their account. Then, as long as their phones connect to the Internet, WAY will show them their location. In addition, users must fill out their profiles by updating their nationality, day of birth, a language they want to use, and so forth. Users also can find their friends’ locations if their friends install WAY by searching their phone numbers and add to their list friends. This step is very similar to the Zalo app. When users have friends on WAY, they can check their friends’ location by opening the app. So what if you are not comfortable to let some of your friends know your location? This question leads me to think about the second feature, which allows users to hide their location. To be more specific, users can choose who they want to hide and the chosen people can only see the last location before users hide their location. 
                    Moreover, the app can also detect the speed of users if they are traveling. By collecting the statistic of users’ speed while users are in traffic, WAY will show which roads are in traffic jams if the speeds of users on those roads are too slow. Hence, checking WAY is an option to know where is the traffic jams so that we can find another way to avoid them. Moreover, the app also has a list of trusted friends who are determined by users. The reason for designing the trusted friends feature is that whenever the user loses connection to the Internet. WAY will send a message to the phone numbers of trusted friends the last locations of users. Then, if the phones connect to the Internet again, WAY will immediately capture the location and send messages to trusted friends’ phones again. This feature helps users know the location of phones in case someone’s phone is stolen and the theft opens the phone to break the password.
                    </cite>
                <br><br>
                <br><br>
                <cite> Another feature is that WAY will depend on where you are to change the background color. For instance, if you are in Vietnam and it is in the morning, you will see the bright background on your app screen while your friend will have dark background color if he/she is in the U.S. Furthermore, based on Google weather, WAY will show your location’s temperature and show sunny, rainy, or snowy effects depending on your location’s status. WAY also has a special feature which allows users to direct message to their friends as social media. Similar to Messenger, Zalo, Instagram, etc., users could send a message to the friend with who they want to chat by both text message and icons. Furthermore, users can search the way to go to their final destination like Google map or let WAY detect the way to their friends’ locations that they want to visit.</cite>
                <br><br>
                <br><br>
                <cite>The purpose of WAY is not only for friends checking location but also for protecting users' safety. For instance, if parents want to find a way to check their children’s locations, WAY is an option so that they would know where their children are and whether their children are lying about their location or not. Another purpose is that WAY would help users know the location of their phones if they lose them. In addition, if you are in traffic and have an accident, the speed will show up 0 km/h in the app, and your friends will notice and call you to check your status. I hope that this app will make people's lives safer. </cite>    
                <br><br>
                <br><br>
                <cite>I also want to make my app more helpful for society, especially for the family. Therefore, I decided to add some modes to WAY. To be more specific, there will be 3 additional modes for families: Young for children, Parent, and Elder. The mode can be set only one time without changing in the future. For Young mode, WAY will base on the places that children stay most to realize their home location and their school, workplace. After several times using WAY, my app will remember the route of users, the time users go to workplaces, and the time users go home. If somehow the route changes, the time Young mode users go to their place late about 15 to 20 minutes, WAY will announce to the Parent mode users about the anomaly. In this way, it would be easier and more efficient for parents to keep track and take care of their children. Similarly, the Elder mode is for looking after the parents, especially the old. In other words, based on the motion sensors installed in smartphones nowadays, if WAY receives any strong shock from motion sensors, checking the period that the Elder mode users stay in that place after strong shock sensors for more than 5 minutes, WAY will announce to the Young mode users and the Parent mode users that connect to that Elder mode person. After receiving the announcement, people in their family could call or come to check if their parents, their grandparents are ok or not. </cite>
                <br><br>
                <br><br>
                <cite>Finally, to make my WAY more unique, I also want to combine some software to develop my app as a social media app. For instance, WAY could recommend people around you so that when you want to find more friends you can use this feature. By recognizing the history of the route, WAY also can detect if users come to new places and then show users some famous places which are collected in specific categories such as parks, restaurants, shopping malls, etc. Those places will be considered base on the rating score from previous users, the price of products, and food so that users could choose the suitable options. Also, WAY will have each group for each certain area in each country. The local people as well as travelers could join the group, communicate with others, and maybe some local people who have free time might agree to take travelers a tour to explore their hometown. If my project is developed and feasible in the future, I will go to some service companies to apply for cooperation. I would then attach a referral link to my clients the services of those companies. For instance, if a user has a vacation in the USA and he/she want to try the service of a station in the U.S, there will be a link to Amtrak app, which is a station app to buy ticket and travel by train. Another example is Lyft which is similar to Uber but it is more economical.</cite>
                <br><br>
                <br><br>
                <cite>Overall, the app will be built as a Client/Server app. Initially, I would use React Native in order to build an app that can run on both the IOS platform and the Android platform. Next, I also need a backend that acts as a server for communication between users who install WAY. One of the most effective ways to build a server is to use Nodejs to code. The reason is that Node.js language is used by both frontend and backend programmers, which is suitable for a more effective and productive working environment and eliminates the need to explain how programs run or what the function of the code is. As a result, it saves more time and money. Besides, the JavaScript programming language has some convenient features for backend development, which makes software developers avoid using other cumbersome options. Another thing that should be highlighted is that I must have a database to gather and save the users’ information. This part could be processed by using Firebase or MySql. Not only will the database save users’ information but it also will be used to save the data between users’ messages, save it so that users could see it later if they want. Furthermore, I could save the distances that users are moving and the time they move to those locations, apply math function to calculate the speed of users. Also, the database will contain categories about available location areas, then based on the user's location to make suitable suggestions about places around them. Following this, I will use Socket.IO to make a connection between Client and Server. In other words, the Client and Server will interact via an intermediate channel (Socket.IO). Finally, to access the user's exact location, the app will locate the user's location via Gps by requesting the user's consent to allow GPS navigation.</cite>

                <br><br>
                <cite>I discussed my project with Binh who is one of my best friends as well as my teammate. First, he told me that the app is similar to other social media apps such as Snapchat, Messenger, and so forth. I had to confess that I am not a big fan of social media. Hence, after researching about Snapchat, I discovered that it has more features than I thought. To be more specific,  
                    I used to know that Snapchat is a social media app so that users can upload their videos, stories, and chat with their friends. Moreover, the app also has some filters to make the video, images fancier. However, Binh also showed me that Snapchat also can check users’ locations and their friends’ locations as well. In the location part, Snapchat’s users can see the places’ weather. In the map, there will be some flash spots represented for other users, which help them find their friends via the app. The second person I asked for advice is one of my team members named Dat. He has the same opinion as to the first one. Dat recommended I check the Zenly app, which is also a location app that can locate your position as well as to detect users’ speed. The last team member I asked is Choi. For the most part, he said that the feature of locating positions of my app is similar to Life360 – which is an app for keep tracking people and smartphones. He advised me to think more and expected me to develop more feature to my app in the future. I agreed with their opinion that my app has some features which are the same as other locations app I mentioned above. However, I am certain that my app would be more comprehensive than other location apps. What I mean is that WAY will not only inherit ideas from previous apps but it also has other features that are necessary for society. The death of comedian Chi Tai is an example. If his smartphone installs an app like WAY, the app can detect and notify his family members about his dangerous situation as well as his location. Another thing that should be highlighted is that WAY is also helpful for people who often travel since they could communicate with local people and immerse themselves in local cultures. In the future, I also want my app to be a place that provides rental services for people all over the world, thereby helping homeowners and those looking for accommodation closer together.
