                </div>
                <cite>The IT professional that I interviewed is Professor Tri Dang Tran who inspired me to pursue an IT career. Besides being an IT professor who teaching Introduction to Programming at RMIT, Professor Tri also used to work as a software developer. To be more specific, a software developer will be given specifications by the company he works for. For instance, the company will demonstrate the detailed tasks they want him to undertake, the outcome of the tasks they expect after finishing the tasks, the language of choice that the company would like to use. After receiving the tasks, Professor Tri will use appropriate programming languages to develop and test functions for the software to make it run more efficiently and correctly. Moreover, he also needs to take into account the implementation of new functions to the existing software and the innovation of the software compared to the previous one, how the software impacts the business, how the product and company performance will be, etc. As a result, a software developer must be able to work with different kinds of programming languages, keep up with today’s advanced technologies and platforms, and so forth. A database management system reasonably exemplifies those aforementioned statements above. What I mean is that to manage the database system in the previous company that Professor Tri worked, he had to decide which one is suitable platform such as MySQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, etc. depending on the time of development, the practical application of the platform, whether team members are familiar with the platform are not, etc.</cite>
                <br><br>
                <br><br>
                
                <cite>To have a thorough perspective about software developers as well as to help me understand the essence of the IT industry nowadays, he shared with me his recent job as a software developer at a Japanese printing company. First, he introduced some information about the company. To be more specific, Japanese people often use decorated cards, envelopes as special gifts to their relatives. Moreover, Japan is the birthplace of much famous manga. Therefore, exploiting the benefits of automatic printing, online printing, physical paper printing, the company applies those software and logistics of delivery on paper to make products such as cards, brochures, comics, etc. Working as a software developer in the company, not only did he have to work with other software developers in his team, but he also had to interact with other departments in the company, the clients, and the vendors who give software developers a platform to work with. However, as he spent the most time on the backend, Professor Tri usually worked with his team instead of working with clients. Also, most of the clients are Japanese who only speak their mother tongue language, which is difficult for Professor Tri to work with them. About the job, Professor Tri was assigned a project that was given Ruby on Rails framework and changed the software written by the PHP programming language to the Ruby programming language.  Particularly, before working for the company, they only have one person who had implemented the PHP language software for 6 years. Realizing the possibility of Ruby language in the future, the company decided to switch to Ruby language. </cite>
                <br><br>
                <br><br>
                <cite>Overall, there are two challenging problems with his job in this printing company. The first difficult problem is that the company had a fixed deadline for Professor Tri and other members to finish transforming the software to Ruby language. Hence, the team must push a lot of efforts and try their best to complete before the deadline whether they had to work all week or stayed up overnight. The second, also main challenging to Professor Tri is that there are no documents about the code in the company. Furthermore, the code did not work independently. Instead, it is related to the whole printing system. For example, the process of printing A4 is different from the process of printing A0, or printing a book is not the same as print a card, etc. Since there are too many variables and tasks, it took the software developers lots of time to understand the function of the PHP programming language software in the company.  Moreover, even if the updated code was finished, it was still very hard to test the code without any documentation. Therefore, Professor Tri had to read, guessed, and understood the function of the previous code, changed the code step by step, and finally test the code in some special cases. Sometimes, he worked individually, but sometimes he also needed to work with teammates so that everyone could help each other, observe the progress of the work as well as exchange knowledge.</cite>
                <br><br>
                <br><br>

                <cite>Besides designing and testing functions of the software, Professor Tri’s job position was also about reviewing other code, providing the goals of the tasks to other software developers. Sometimes, he could take part in the human resource department in charge of interviews to recruit IT, members, to his team. Moreover, he shared that the most important thing in terms of recruiting a person is his/her personality. In other words, not only do employers evaluate the professional skills of a person, but they do also consider whether his/her personality will be suitable for the job position as well as how to work with the team or not.</cite>
                <br><br>
                <br><br>

                <cite>In the IT industry overall, I also asked Professor Tri what aspect of the work that he found most challenging and what aspect of work that he spent the most time on. In terms of time spending, Professor Tri shared that he spent most of his time on developing software, and the rest is for reviewing the codes, reading the documents to learn more, and working on paper documents. There are two most challenges when pursuing an IT career. The first difficulty that should be highlighted is that we always have to explore and cultivate knowledge every day to progress as well as keep up with today's advanced technology trends. As Gen Zs are young and creative to explore new technologies and information, it is easier to keep up with IT trends. As we get older, it becomes harder and harder to remember, absorb, and keep up with trends. Another challenge that should be mentioned is that IT developers must understand the coding language as well as how the software interacts in the entire system in the business.</cite>
                <br><br>
                <br><br>

                <cite>Finally, I also wondered what motive made the company decide to switch from PHP to Ruby. The Professor answered me that Ruby had more advantages compared to PHP. To be more specific, Ruby helps programmers reduce many lines of code because of the already common functions in the library. Therefore, the software using Ruby will run faster and more efficiently. Moreover, since Ruby is a modern language, it would be easier for software developers to understand, check, and fix the code, reuse them in the future. </cite>
                <br><br>
                <br><br>

                <cite>Thanks to the interview, I learned a lot about software development which is one of the future careers I want to try in the future. Also, I understood about new language Ruby and realized some challenges in this career. </cite>
